# ChurnCast â€“ Customer Churn Prediction for Banks

This project is a machine learning application that predicts customer churn for banks, using multiple classification models. The system includes a Python-based GUI developed with PyQt6 and supports model training, evaluation, and prediction from both individual and bulk input.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a software tool that integrates ML models to predict whether a bank customer is likely to leave, helping banks improve customer retention strategies.

**Models Implemented:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (tuned with RandomizedSearchCV)

**Best model selected:** `XGBoost` achieved the highest accuracy (90.4%) and F1-score (0.901).

## ðŸ§  Features

- Load data and preprocess (One-hot encoding, StandardScaler, SMOTE)
- Train and test multiple ML models
- Evaluate models with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualize confusion matrix and churn distributions
- Predict churn for new customer entries or CSV batch files
- GUI Interface with login/reset password functions
